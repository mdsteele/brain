Brain is a console-based to-do list program, with a pithy command language that
makes it very quick to, for example:

  - Create new to-do tasks
  - Specify that task A depends on task B, supporting arbitrary DAG structures
  - Specify that a task requires some particular context (e.g. I need to have
    internet for some task)
  - Specify that context A is a subcontext of B (e.g. if I'm at home, I have
    internet)
  - Query what tasks I could do right now, given that I'm currently e.g. at
    home
  - Query what I need to do each day for the next week and in what order,
    taking into account due dates and dependencies

...and a bunch of other things.  There are, of course, already a thousand other
to-do list programs in the world; I like this one mainly because it's light
weight, and because I wrote it and can thus easily add new things to it
whenever I think of them.  I wrote this program with only myself in mind, but
perhaps someone else will find it useful or interesting.
